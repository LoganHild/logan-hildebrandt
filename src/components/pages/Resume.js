      <h3>LOGAN HILDEBRANDT</h3>
      <p>
        Full-stack web developer leveraging a background in customer service and care for disabled 
        adults. Working with disabled adults provided skills in working with others and goal-oriented tasks while developing skills with 
        decision making and problem solving as an independent staff member. About 6 years in total spent in this position taught skills in how to stay focused, 
        organized,  calm under stress, and to adapt to change. These skills were demonstrated when a client we were serving became physically aggressive towards 
        staff and other clients. My immediate action was to divide roles between 3 staff for documentation/relocation of other clients, contacting supervisors for 
        the support needed, and myself working on de-escalating the physically aggressive client. This quick thinking allowed for a quick and safe solution to be 
        achieved for all parties while being commended by the supervisor and nursing when they arrived. These skills will allow me to find solutions to nearly any
        problem faced in a new position. Recently earned a certificate in full-stack development from the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp, learning quickly 
        to gain proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal with these newly acquired skills is to create a user-friendly, accessible, and interactive web 
        experience for every user, while aligning with specific goals and exceeding expectations.
